//! Quote-state parity computation.
//!
//! Given a 64-bit mask of unescaped quote positions in a 64-byte
//! stripe, plus the parity carried in from the previous stripe,
//! compute the per-byte "inside string" mask: bit `i` is `1` iff
//! byte `stripe_base + i` is between an unescaped opening quote and
//! its matching closing quote.
//!
//! The classical simdjson trick: prefix-XOR the quote mask. With CLMUL
//! against the all-ones polynomial, the prefix-XOR is one PMULL/CLMUL
//! op per stripe. Without CLMUL, the same prefix can be computed via
//! a 6-op shift-XOR ladder (Lemire's "fast parsing" §6.1):
//!
//! ```text
//! x = quote_mask
//! x ^= x << 1
//! x ^= x << 2
//! x ^= x << 4
//! x ^= x << 8
//! x ^= x << 16
//! x ^= x << 32
//! ```
//!
//! Both forms produce the same 64-bit prefix-XOR; either is folded
//! with the carried parity bit from the previous stripe (XOR).
//!
//! This module is arch-neutral; the AVX2 + NEON kernels call
//! [`prefix_xor_64`] directly, which selects CLMUL or shift-XOR by
//! `cfg!(target_feature)`. The output is the in-string mask suitable
//! for AND-NOT'ing against the structural-byte mask before compaction.
