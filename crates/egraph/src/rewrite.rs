//! Rewrite rules: search for patterns and add equivalences.
//!
//! A rewrite rule is a named pair of a *searcher* (finds matches in the
//! e-graph) and an *applier* (installs the rewritten form as a new e-node
//! in the matched class). Unlike destructive rewrites, applying a rewrite
//! never removes the original form — it only adds a new equivalence.

/// rule implements `search` directly and returns the list of e-class IDs
/// it would like to rewrite (plus any rule-specific match data). `apply`
/// then installs the new form for each match. This mirrors `csp-solver`'s
/// constraint-with-domain approach — more verbose than a pattern DSL but
