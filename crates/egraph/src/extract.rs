//! Cost-model-driven extraction.
//!
//! Given a saturated e-graph, extraction picks the cheapest term rooted at
//! a chosen e-class. The cheapest term is selected bottom-up: each e-class
//! is assigned the cost of its cheapest e-node, computed from child-class
//! costs.
//!
//! This is the Egg "greedy bottom-up" algorithm. It's not optimal for
//! all cost models (e.g., cost models that depend on sharing require a
//! more sophisticated extractor), but it works for the monotone cost
//! models used by grammar/regex optimization.
