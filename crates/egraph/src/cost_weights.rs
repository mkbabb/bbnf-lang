//! Shared extraction cost weights for any e-graph consumer.

//! A single source of truth for the cost weights whose meaning is

//! alternation-branch penalty, and the dispatch bonus that rewards
//! forms enabling constant-time dispatch at emission time.
//!
//! Domain-specific cost models (e.g., `bbnf_ir::egraph::GrammarCostModel`,
//! `bbnf_regex::egraph::RegexExtractionCost`) embed this struct and
//! layer their own per-variant knobs on top. Splitting the shared
//! weights across domains creates drift and is forbidden.
